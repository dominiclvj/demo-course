## Hello World

### Learning
Welcome to your first Python coding challenge! You will learn how to write a simple Python program and understand how the ```print()``` function works.

Python is a popular, beginner-friendly programming language. One of the first tasks every programmer undertakes is writing a Hello World program. This is a simple program that displays the message "Hello World!" on the screen.

### Challenge
Here's what you need to do:
- In Python, we use the ```print()``` function to display output. The print function takes text or other information inside the parenthesis and outputs it to the console.

- To display a simple message saying "Hello World!" you can use the print function as follows: ```print("Hello World!")```.

- Once you've managed to print "Hello World!" to the console, try changing the double-quotes ```"``` to single-quotes ```'``` and see what happens.
